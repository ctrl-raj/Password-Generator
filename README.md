🛡️ Password Generator (CLI)

A simple yet functional command-line password generator built in Python. This tool allows you to generate secure random passwords, save them with custom names, and retrieve them later using a master password system.
🔧 Features

- ✅ Random password generation with customizable length

- 🔢 Option to include numbers and/or punctuation

- 💾 Auto-save passwords with user-defined names

- 🔐 Master password protection for viewing and searching saved passwords

- 📂 Local file-based password storage (PasswordGen-Database.txt)

🚀 Getting Started

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PASSWORD-GENERATOR.git
cd PASSWORD-GENERATOR

Run the script:

    python PasswordGenerator.py

🧠 To-Do (for me)

- Add GUI using tkinter or PyQt

- Encrypt stored passwords

- Implement password update/delete features

- Save data in .json or .sqlite format

💡 Note

This is an early CLI version. Perfect for learning Python basics, file handling, user input, and basic security logic.
